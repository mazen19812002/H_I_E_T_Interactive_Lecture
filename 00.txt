Create a single-file, offline-capable HTML application serving as a bilingual (English/Arabic) interactive educational resource explicitly designed for university  low-achieving learners.
The design and functionality must strictly follow the specifications below to present and fully explain the entire attached PDF in extreme detail — no summarization, no omission, no compression.
All content must be:
•	Completely covered, including every single page of the PDF.
•	Broken down into very small, sequential steps
•	Explained using simple, clear language
•	Supported with examples, restatements, and visual cues
•	Repeated where necessary using different explanations to ensure understanding
•	Any activity must have at least 5 items
•	Multiple-choice questions must always have exactly 4 options
The page must be suitable for learners who:
•	Struggle with comprehension
•	Need slow pacing
•	Require explicit guidance and reinforcement
•	Cannot infer meaning without direct explanation
________________________________________
Learning Objectives
•	Present all learning objectives formulated according to Bloom’s Taxonomy, ranging from Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, to Create.
•	Each objective must include:
o	A very simple explanation
o	Expected learner actions
o	Visual confirmation of mastery (e.g., interactive checklist with strikethrough)
________________________________________
Resources & Strategies
•	Clearly list all materials and resources needed for the lesson.
•	Provide strategies for instruction; strategies will be per lesson part and predefined, e.g., Lecture, Cooperative Learning, Self-Learning.
•	Resources and strategies must be explicitly linked to each part of the lesson to support low-achiever learners.

Interactive Lesson Flow
1.	Review
o	Activities that reinforce prior knowledge and consolidate previously learned material.
o	Must be interactive, simple, and clearly guided for low-achiever learners.
o	Each activity must have at least 5 items.
o	Visual aids, examples, and step-by-step instructions are mandatory.
2.	Warm-up
o	Activities designed to prepare learners for the lesson in hand.
o	Must activate curiosity and engage attention in an easy-to-follow way.
o	Each activity must have at least 5 items.
o	Visuals, examples, and simple interactivity must be included.
3.	Presentation
o	The lesson is divided into clearly numbered parts.
o	Each part has its own strategy selection dropdown from the predefined list.
o	When a strategy is selected:
	Teacher Role Panel (Amber) explains step-by-step how the teacher presents that part.
	Student Role Panel (Blue) explains exactly how students interact, using explicit, easy-to-follow actions.
o	Each part must include:
	Full detailed explanation of content
	Visual aids (charts, diagrams, emojis)
	Key terms explained in simple language
	Reinforcement examples
4.	Practice
o	Includes activities that allow learners to apply what they learned.
o	Activities must be interactive, scaffolded, and simple, with feedback and guidance.
o	Each activity must have at least 5 items.
o	Activities should correspond directly to the parts in the presentation.
5.	Assignment
o	Tasks that extend learning outside the app.
o	Instructions must be clear, step-by-step, and low-pressure.
o	Each activity must have at least 5 items.

Final Evaluation
•	Questions must be grouped under Learning Objectives.
•	Each objective must have at least 10 questions.
•	Questions must be distributed across all levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create).
•	Multiple-choice questions must always have exactly 4 options.
•	Question types:
o	Interactive multiple-choice
o	Immediate feedback:
	✅ Green + explanation for correct
	❌ Red + shake animation + simplified correction for incorrect
•	Language must be encouraging, supportive, and low-stress for learners.

Technical Requirements
•	Single-file HTML: Embed all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; no external libraries.
•	Bilingual support:
o	Header toggle switches all text and layout (LTR/RTL).
o	Centralized JSON object for all translatable text.
•	Offline capability: Fully functional without internet.
•	Responsive design: Mobile, tablet, desktop.
•	Dynamic strategy panels: Each lesson part updates Teacher/Student panels individually when a strategy is selected.
•	Interactive elements: Objectives checklist, activities, practice tasks, review activities, evaluation questions.
